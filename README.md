WEBSITE - for the customer website component using Gradle, HTTPServlet library, and various classes.
JSP files contain HTML code corresponding to each Servlet class - these have been created for readability.

- In order to add items to your basket, you must have created and be logged into an account, you will not be able to proceed with an order otherwise.
- Basket item quantities can be updated in the Basket page, or by adding the existing item to the basket again via the Browse page. Updating by the latter will replace with the new quantity chosen, rather than adding the quantity to an existing item in the basket.
- The quantity maximum for unlimited products is 5, this was chosen arbitrarily.
- Existing users can amend their card details and shipping address on the Amend Details page. Any entries left empty will not be updated.
